A repository for my personal solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in the [Bok programming language](https://github.com/autocorr/bok).
If you are looking for *good* examples, take these with a grain of salt, since I am still learning about concatenative and stack-oriented languages.
Someone more experienced with Forth, Joy, and/or Factor could likely very easily come up with better solutions.
